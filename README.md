# SpellNotifications
_Thanks to Veev for creating the original version_
This is a refactor of Veevs original SpellNotifications addon that works with TBC classic.
- Thanks to LucyOn for updating it for Retail [(GitHub)](https://github.com/jobackman/SpellNotifications) - [(CurseForge)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spellnotifications).

# What does the addon do?
For those who are new to SpellNotifications it's an addon that textually displays:

- When you dispel (offensively, defensively, or spellstolen), what was dispelled
- When you interrupt a spell and what school was interrupted
- When you reflect or ground a spell (Comming soon)
- When your attacks, spells or heals are _immuned_, _evaded_ or similar effects. (Comming soon)

# What has changed from the original?
You can expect the same functionality as with the original version, except from a few things that I might add back in a later version.
- Sound warnings
- Offensive cooldown warnings
